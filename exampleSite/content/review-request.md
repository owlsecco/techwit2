# Review Guidelines and Request Submition

At _TechWit Ke_, we are dedicated to provide the most useful and accurate information to our users, and reviewing products/services is a part of the same. If you want to get your product/service reviewed by us, submit it down below

Read our guidelines mentioned ahead that must be fulfilled by your product/service to make them eligible for review. We accept apps, extensions, electronic gadgets, web apps, and other products/services that suit the theme of _TechWit Ke_.

1. Your app, extension, or gadget must be your own intellectual property as we don’t accept duplicity and copying. We accept demos, trials, free accounts and test versions for review but make sure they are stable and secure as the product being shared with our users is should be of top quality.
2. Your app must be hosted on Google Play Store, Apple Store, or Windows Store. Similarly, your extensions must be available on suitable platforms.
3. The products and services that target our audience will be prioritized. Don’t send us a review request if it’s just for promotional purposes, such requests will be rejected.
4. If the app or service has some adult or pornographic content, or if it is offensive in any manner, it’ll be rejected.
5. It should fulfill the quality standards and should be in coherence with the theme of TechWit Ke (if you know us, you’ll know what we are all about).
6. For apps and extensions, we need 2 weeks and your review request will be queued in our review pipeline as soon as it is approved by us.
7. For gadgets and other products that will be shipped to us, we need 3 weeks as we test them accordingly and our aim is to provide complete and accurate information to our readers.
8. The gadgets must be sent with the complete specification, manufacturing, and pricing details.
