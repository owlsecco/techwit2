Hi, how are you?

## Background

TechWit is a Tech, Cybersecurity and Development Blog started on August 1st 2020.

We are still new into the content delivery space. But our authors are not.

You can take a look into our [**editor in chief's personal tech blog**](https://ajulusthoughts.wordpress.com "author's personal tech blog") to know that we know how to deliver content and gain views. Though our main aim is teaching, we understand potential advertisers will be interested in views as well. So we are working day and night to make sure this site is attractive not only to you(advertisers) but also to you(our viewers).

## Letter To Early Potential Advertisers

If you would like to advertise here. Now's your chance to create a long lasting relationship with us. Advertisers who are interested in advertising here now(early stages of this blog) get benefits. Such as

* Permanent Partnership with us
* You'll get the best spot for ads
* You'll motivate us to pump out content.
* More ......

Yes that's right more.

This blog is not going to be built in a day. We are working hard to complete it. We'll feature a tool list. If your product or service qualifies as a tech, cybersecurity or development tool, you can be sure you'll be featured. Although this isn't a one off thing for all. We'll need to make sure your tool is worthy to be in that spot.

In addition, you can expect a review of your tool. NB: Please don't rush us when we agree to review your tool. Each of our authors have day jobs, school and more. Reviews require thorough research. So you can be sure you tool(being advertised) will be reviewed but in due time. We won't give you a date and if we do, ignore it. All advertised tools will be reviewed automatically and in a specific order that we wont disclose right now. If you are one of our advertisement partners and would like to move your tool/service up the list, kindly contact us.

## Letter To Indecisive Advertisers

We understand the risk involved in advertising here(TechWit Ke v0 - 2). We wouldn't ask you to take that risk without knowing the potential outcome. But we ask take a look around and spend as much time to make a decision as possible. But if you do come to a "negative" decision. You will be missing out ðŸ˜‰ of the potential benefits for your company/tool/service. The benefit list is still not over. So think some more and we hope you come around to a "positive" decision.

## Letter To Late Advertisers

Don't worry the fun isn't over yet. You could still partner with us and get some of the benefits. So cheer up and go to our [Contact Page ](/contact "Contact Page")and partner with us.

## General

Would you like to advertise your company here?

We offer 3 advertisement spaces in this blog.
