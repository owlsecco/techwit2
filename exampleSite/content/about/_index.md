TechWit Kenya is a Tech, Cybersecurity and Development Blog focused on delivering quality and easy to understand content. Our aim is to make our content applicable to all our readers whether you are tech savvy or not.

Stephen Ajulu formed this blog on August 1st 2020 in an attempt to teach, encourage and help individuals to learn about our 3 main topics:

* Technology
* Cybersecurity
* Development

Since it's founding 3 people have joined TechWit Ke as content creators and we are still accepting more.

Our content comes in the following types

* Tips
* Tricks
* Tutorials/Howtos
* News
* Offers
* Biased Reviews
* Reviews
* and more .....

But we are not limited to the main 3 topics or the 7 content types. As you know tech is a wide area of study. So expect more quality content.

## Our Stack

This site uses Hugo, a static site generator that uses Go. The theme is Twenty Twenty by WordPress ported to Themefisher. Using the best Git based headless CMS: Forestry in our opinion. Hosted on GitHub(yes we made this site open source) with Netlify handling deployment. Aside from these, we have custom made shortcodes linked to forestry cms snippets for a smooth shortcode injection. The site isn't complete yet but we are working day and night to make sure we complete it so that you can start enjoying quality content so expect more features.

So we would like to send a special "Thank You" to the following:
