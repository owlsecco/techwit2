Hi, there? My name is Stephen Ajulu, the Founder of SAOA Media and Editor in Chief of TechWit Ke, and this is the beginning and rise of TechWit Ke.

To begin, let me explain our stack.

### Framework: Hugo

It is a static site generator built on Go.

We chose it because of it's fast build time, built on Go, no server side rendering, easy to understand docs, great for blogs, suitable for large websites and finally because it has a great community.

With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

### Host: GitHub

Supports collaborations, has a free plan, has good support and is easy to use.

### Deployment: Netlify

Oh so many wonderful things to say about Netlify with so little space.

We use Netlify for Continuous Deployment. Each time we make a commit. Netlify starts building the site. Hence the word continuous. It doesn't require manual effort as long as it's connected to GitHub. Support Snippet Injection, Functions, Plugins and more.

### Content Management System: Forestry CMS

From a beautiful and simple interface to snippets that can be paired with hugo shortcodes. This really is the best git based headless cms for Hugo.

We choose these platforms for their user friendly, reliability and quality.

As you know TechWit Ke is a brand under the SAOA Media Group.

We have a commitment to delivering quality tech, cybersecurity and development content.

Next time we'll talk about the other services we use.

Till then, have a great day!
